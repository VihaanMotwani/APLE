        "strengths": "The tutee demonstrated a clear understanding of the water cycle's main stages, the role of the solar energy, and the influence of gravity. Their explanations on the water cycle\u2019s impact on climate, weather patterns, and the effects of human activities on the water cycle were detailed and well-supported.",
        "areas_for_improvement": "For question Q1, while listing additional stages isn't incorrect, it was not aligned with the core stages described in the prompt. It's important also to focus on explicitly required stages. Also, ensure to tie back effects or changes in the holistic view of the system as seen in Q6 analysis.",
        "suggested_next_steps": "The tutee can explore more in-depth topics on the water cycle, such as the interaction between the water cycle and climate change. Additionally, they could explore human impact and sustainable practices in greater detail."
