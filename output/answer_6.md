The effect of human activities on the water cycle, as stated in the knowledge base, includes:

- **Urban Development**: The construction of infrastructure such as roads and buildings decreases infiltration, leading to increased runoff. This can result in flooding. Urban development also often leads to deforestation, which reduces transpiration. This reduction in transpiration can decrease atmospheric water content, potentially reducing rainfall.

These human-induced changes can disrupt the natural balance of the water cycle, impacting both ecosystems and human activities.
