Condensation in the water cycle occurs when water vapor cools at higher altitudes, transforming back into tiny droplets to form clouds. This process is crucial as it leads to the formation of clouds, which are necessary for precipitation. By contributing to cloud formation, condensation plays a key role in the movement and distribution of water across the Earth's surface, as part of the continuous loop involving the cycle's interrelated processes.
