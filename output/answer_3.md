Precipitation occurs when clouds become too heavy, causing the water to fall to the Earth as rain, snow, etc. In the water cycle, it plays a crucial role as the process that returns water from the atmosphere to the Earth's surface, allowing it to eventually participate in other stages like infiltration and runoff. It supports ecosystems by providing necessary moisture for plant growth and replenishes water sources crucial for human activities.
